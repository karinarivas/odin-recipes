<h2>Description of Dish</h2>
<p>This bruschetta with mozzarella recipe is the perfect appetizer. Quick and easy to make, super fresh, and tastes fantastic.
    Everyone will fall in love with this combination of tomato, basil, and mozzarella.
    Originally, bruschetta was born as cheap food for peasants. They are is during the rare breaks from work in the fields. 
    It served both as a hearty snack or meal for those doing hard manual labor, and as a way to salvage bread that had gone stale.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Tomatoes</li>
 <li>Mozzarella</li>
 <li>Baguette</li>
 <li>Butter</li>
 <li>Basil</li>
 <li>Olive Oil</li>
 <li>Garlic</li>
 <li>Salt</li>
 <li>Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.
 We'll need this to prepare the baguette that serves as the base of our appetizer.</li>
 <li>Slice the top off the tomatoes, then cut in half. Cut the halves into smaller pieces and put in a larger bowl.</li>
 <li>Next, gather up all your fresh basil. You're going to cut it into thin strips.
    Put it into the bowl with the tomatoes, and then add in the fresh mozzarella cheese.</li>
<li>Now drizzle the mixture with olive oil and with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Toss together well and put this bowl aside in the fridge for later.</li>
<li>Now, cut the baguette at an angle into pieces. You should have about 3/4 inch slices
    and coat these with butter evenly. Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet and cook for 10 minutes or
    until golden brown. (be sure to turn them over once during cooking)</li>
<li>Scoop a heaping amount of the tomato mixture onto each piece of baguette, sprinkle with a little more salt,
    drizzle with balsamic glaze and serve.</li>
</ol>
