    <ol>
     <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, boil water and salt it. Add your pasta, and cook according to the package instructions 
        until al dente. When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta.</li>
    <li>In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter, and add olive oil. Cook the shrimp for a minute, then season with 
        salt, pepper, and Old Bay Seasoning or paprika if using.</li>
    <li>Continue to cook the shrimp until it's pink. Do this in batches if you're worried that you may overcook the shrimp.
         Remove the shrimp onto a plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>In the same pan, melt butter and add garlic, cook for 30 seconds or until it's fragrant. Add the heavy cream, and
         with the spatula deglaze the pan.</li>
    <li>Add parmesan, let it melt then loosen the sauce with reserved pasta water and allow to simmer for a minute. Taste 
        the sauce and see if more salt and pepper is needed.</li>
    <li>Toss the pasta with the sauce until it's well coated. Add the shrimp back in to reheat it gently, garnish with freshly
         chopped parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
